This project is about a game that doesn't end with a win or a lost flag, this simulation is
to be enjoyable and meditating. Bamboos are well-known for the meditating sounds
they produce, and their use in flutes and other instruments. Therefore, the focus of the game is on the bamboos, flutes and their meditating influence. 

This Project is a randomly composed music game. The visuals resemble a bamboo
Forest. There is a base melody playing in the background and the user adds some random single notes (single notes played by the flute) to the melody.

But to make their own random melody they have to play the game. There is a ball that is falling from the top, and is moving downward and to the sides. The user controls the movements of the ball by clicking the mouse. With each click, the direction of the downfall changes from right to left.

The bubbles that hold the notes, are between the bamboo trees. The user leads the blue ball to the notes but has to make sure not to get stuck between the benches. If the user gets stuck ,the benches bring the ball upward until there is a rescue way between the trees. These rescues are introduced as gates between the trees, once the users get to their level, they can press the left or right arrow keys to pass through the gate and continue catching the bubbles. 

Each time the user catches the bubble the random note plays and harmonizes the melody. These notes can be surprising combined with the main melody (which can be fun) but the final outcome is rather relaxing that surprising. 

What I had in my mind was a game that could feel my free hours and make me relaxed, without me worrying about the end of the game and on the other hand, isn't boring. The minimal visuals and shapes match the calming melody of the game too. The mentioned experience is the main goal of this game.
