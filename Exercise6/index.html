    <h2> New York Times Article </h2>
    <p>
      Oprah Winfrey’s recent interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made it clear that the inner workings of Buckingham Palace are largely mysterious. Harry suggested that information is often distorted by a mutually beneficial relationship between the royal family and the British tabloids. Mark Landler, a former White House correspondent and Hong Kong bureau chief for The New York Times, began reporting on the British <span class="top-secret revealed">mona<u>r</u>chy</span> when he became the London bureau chief in 2019. Here, he discusses the obstacles involved in covering the royals.
      What is the biggest challenge in reporting on the royal family?
      The opaque nature of the institution. It’s not as if Queen <span class="top-secret revealed">Elizab<u>e</u>th</span> holds news conferences or invites in reporters for <span class="top-secret revealed">backgroun<u>d</u></span> conversations.  <span class="top-secret revealed">Mu<u>c</u>h </span>of the intrigue that dominates royal family coverage comes necessarily second-, third- or even fourth-hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Is there anything you have to do differently when covering the royals?
      The biggest adjustment is understanding that this is not like covering the White House or any other government institution. It is actually more akin to writing about the senior ranks of the Chinese  <span class="top-secret revealed">C<u>o</u>mmunist</span> Party, where the machinations play out behind closed doors.
      There is an unmistakable dash of Hollywood about the beat, though as the Meghan-and-Harry saga illustrates, the royals <span class="top-secret revealed">han<u>d</u>le</span> public relations very differently. And while you can’t cover it like the White House, there was an odd<span class="top-secret revealed"> parall<u>e</u>l</span> between Buckingham Palace and  <span class="top-secret revealed">e<u>x</u>pected</span> Donald Trump’s White House — a sense of a  <span class="top-secret revealed">k<u>i</u>ng </span>surrounded by his jealous <span class="top-secret revealed">cour<u>t</u>iers</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Americans’ knowledge of the inner workings of Buckingham Palace comes from “The Crown.” Is that a mistake? Is there a <span class="top-secret revealed">bet<u>t</u>er</span> depiction elsewhere? <span class="top-secret revealed">W<u>h</u>y</span> does Buckingham Palace seem so <span class="top-secret revealed">myst<u>e</u>rious</span> to us?
      As the creators of “The Crown” admit, they take artistic <span class="top-secret revealed">li<u>b</u>erties</span> with their depiction of the private lives of the royals. But they do historical research for the set design and props, so the series gives a good <span class="top-secret revealed">flavo<u>u</u>r </span>of the <span class="top-secret revealed">per<u>i</u>od</span>, if not of the<span class="top-secret revealed"> actua<u>l</u></span> events. The best behind-the-scenes account of the family may be “Royal Family,” a 1969 documentary for which the queen allowed the producers to bring cameras into the palace. It aired only once on the BBC and then was <span class="top-secret revealed">hid<u>d</u>en </span>away in a vault, supposedly at the family’s request.
    </p>

    <p>
      What do you think was the most significant impact of the Oprah interview?
      Meghan’s claim that a member of the royal family raised concerns about the <span class="top-secret revealed">sk<u>i</u>n</span> color of her future child will resonate loudest and longest. For a <span class="top-secret revealed">cou<u>n</u>try</span> like Britain, which is confronting its own legacy of racism, <span class="top-secret revealed">allegations</span> of racism at the highest levels of the royal family are devastating. We’ve now seen Harry’s brother, William, flatly deny that the family is racist.
