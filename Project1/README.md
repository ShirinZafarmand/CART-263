Project 1- Caroline
Artistic Statement
Due Date: 25th of February

This project is an animation-inspired game. The chosen animation is a successful stop motion called Caroline which I have been obsessing over for years. It is about a girl who finds herself in an alternative world where everything is interesting and fun as well as her parents. The only difference is that everyone in that world has buttons sewed on their faces instead of eyes. Slowly she finds the dark truth behind this seemingly perfect world. The evil mom tells her the only way for her to survive from this world is to give up her eyes and have buttons instead of them. During her escape she finds the haunted ghosts of 3 children that had already fallen for the evil momâ€™s trick and has given up their eyes. In order to rescue them she has to find their eyes that are hidden. The only way that these balls are visible to eyes is to look through the hole of the magical triangle-shaped stone. 

In this game the user has to find these 3 eyeballs with the help of the stone that is controlled by hand with the help of the webcam(ml5). Once the stone is over the eyeballs, they appear and the score goes higher. The user needs to find the eyeballs before the button shadow takes up the whole screen. In order to explore the room shown in the game completely, the user can use the arrow keys to change the view. 

In the previous exercises and projects, I had preferred and picked the minimalistic approach, but this time I tried to take a step further and play with the transparent images and more complicated visuals. 
I tried to use mI5 in a way that is more interactive and fun and motivates the user to play the game. Throughout the game I attempted  to maintain the creepy concept of the animation by audios and images that either I created or used as a reference.
